	<p>jQuery.spatialFocus is a <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> plugin which lets you use arrow keys (or any other 
	arrow-like directional information) to navigate focusable elements. It does this by creating a spatial map of all focusable
	elements on the page, then applying heuristics to calculate the closest elements above, below and to the right and left. This
	map can be queried using the $(x).spatialMap() feature.</p>

	<p>This page is managed by spatialFocus, so you can use your arrow keys to test the functionality. Note that no hints are needed,
	spatialFocus is intelligently guessing how elements should be linked together in the map.</p>
