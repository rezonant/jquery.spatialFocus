jquery.spatialFocus
===================
jQuery.spatialFocus is a jQuery plugin which lets you use arrow keys (or any other
arrow-like directional information) to navigate focusable elements. It does this by creating a spatial map of all focusable
elements on the page, then applying heuristics to calculate the closest elements above, below and to the right and left. This
map can be queried using the $(x).spatialMap() feature.
